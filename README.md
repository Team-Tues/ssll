Codename SSLL (Single-Sided Liquidity Launchpad)

**What is Single-Sided Liquidity?** Liquidity that only holds one of the two tokens in a pool.

**What is Launchpad?** A place where you can create your own token and launch it on the market.

SSLL uses single sided liquidity to create a token that can be traded on the market. 100% of the liquidity is deposited *directly* into the DEX. There's no need to migrate liquidity (pump). By depositing directly into a audited DEX, users can trade on a familiar platform.
